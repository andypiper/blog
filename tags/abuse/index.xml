Let’s dive in!
Growing the team First of all, we are delighted to announce a new member of the core development team - David Roetzel joined us as a core web developer. Welcome, @dave!
Keeping things secure During June, we investigated and fixed (and tested the patches for) 3 security issues.</description></item><item><title>Highlighting journalism on Mastodon</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/07/highlighting-journalism-on-mastodon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/07/highlighting-journalism-on-mastodon/</guid><description>To reinforce and encourage Mastodon as the go-to place for journalism, we’re launching a new feature today. You will notice that underneath some links shared on Mastodon, the author byline can be clicked to open the author’s associated fediverse account, right in the app. This highlights writers and journalists that are active on the fediverse, and makes it easier than ever to follow them and keep up with their future work—potentially across different publications.</description></item><item><title>Trunk &amp; Tidbits, May 2024</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/06/trunk-tidbits-may-2024/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/06/trunk-tidbits-may-2024/</guid><description>Welcome again to Trunk &amp;amp; Tidbits, our engineering updates blog series. Let us fill you in on what we’ve been focused on during this past month.
Releases you should know about During May, we released some important updates for the 4.2 and 4.1 releases, and nightly builds. They contain minor security fixes, as well as bug fixes. Thanks to the BSI for sponsoring a pentest of our codebase, which helped us find and fix some of these issues.</description></item><item><title>Trunk &amp; Tidbits, April 2024</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/05/trunk-tidbits-april-2024/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/05/trunk-tidbits-april-2024/</guid><description>Welcome to the first in a planned ongoing series of updates from the core Mastodon engineering team. We’ll also take a quick look at what’s been happening around the broader community.
What we’ve been working on The Mastodon 4.3 release is around the corner - we only have one big feature (grouped notifications) to finish before the first beta release! Let’s dive in on some of the most important things that have been merged lately.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon forms new U.S. non-profit</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/04/mastodon-forms-new-u.s.-non-profit/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/04/mastodon-forms-new-u.s.-non-profit/</guid><description>As part of our commitment to supporting the growth and operational capabilities of Mastodon, we have established a 501(c)(3) non-profit entity in the United States aimed at facilitating our efforts, including being able to receive tax-deductible U.S. donations and in-kind support.
We’re excited to announce the Board of Directors governing this newly formed entity:
Esra’a Al Shafei is a human rights advocate and founder of Majal.org, a network of digital platforms that amplify under-reported and marginalized voices in Southwest Asia and North Africa.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon stuffed toy coming soon</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/04/mastodon-stuffed-toy-coming-soon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/04/mastodon-stuffed-toy-coming-soon/</guid><description>After we’ve released our new line of merch last year, we’ve heard a lot of questions about a potential stuffed toy. After all, our official mascot is so suitable. But it is, problematically, a two-dimensional character.
We sat down with our artist, Dopatwo, to try and imagine what a character like that could look like in three-dimensional space. We had only three requirements: He would have to be cute, he would have to be cuddly, and he would have to be round.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon for Android update</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/02/mastodon-for-android-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/02/mastodon-for-android-update/</guid><description>At the beginning of February, our team attended our very first conference at FOSDEM in Brussels. As a remote-only company, it was also the first time a lot of us met each other in real life. It was a very fun time, and a lot of people came up to take selfies in front of our company roll-up, buy our mugs, and tell us what they&amp;rsquo;d like to see in Mastodon.</description></item><item><title>Improving the quality of conversations on Mastodon</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/11/improving-the-quality-of-conversations-on-mastodon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/11/improving-the-quality-of-conversations-on-mastodon/</guid><description>In our most recent Mastodon for Android release, we’re testing a new feature aimed to curb unneccesary negativity that comes from being on the Internet. Complete strangers using an overly familiar tone, offering unsolicited advice, or starting arguments that are completely besides the point—these should be familiar to all who use social media.
While we’re exploring multiple different avenues to tackle this issue, the idea we’re experimenting with today is simply reminding people when they’re about to respond to a stranger.</description></item><item><title>Thank you Sujitech</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/11/thank-you-sujitech/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/11/thank-you-sujitech/</guid><description>Today we would like to thank Sujitech for kindly donating $100k USD to Mastodon, by far the largest single donation to our non-profit so far. Building Mastodon, which encompasses the core software on one end, and two native mobile applications on the other, is not cheap, and we can only afford a handful of full-time positions right now, relying in many ways on volunteer work.
Sujitech is a Japanese tech company whose mission is to achieve a truly free and open internet, and that has supported Mastodon in various ways for many years.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon for Android update</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/10/mastodon-for-android-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/10/mastodon-for-android-update/</guid><description>The most recent update of Mastodon for Android introduces a highly anticipated feature&amp;ndash;lists. With the new update, you now have the ability to create custom lists and categorize your follows based on specific topics or interests, while removing them from your home feed.
This not only helps in decluttering your home feed but also allows you to engage with certain topics on your own terms, when you are ready. Additionally, we reworked the home tab to provide easy navigation between your home feed, lists, and followed hashtags, so you can get the most out of your experience on Mastodon.</description></item><item><title>Annual Report 2022</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/10/annual-report-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/10/annual-report-2022/</guid><description>Some of your were asking for it, some of you had no idea it was coming. The 2022 Annual Report is ready! As a non-profit organization supported exclusively by donations, we like to keep our community updated on our yearly progress, and 2022 was an interesting year to say the least. Keep in mind though that we&amp;rsquo;re already more than halfway through 2023, and a lot of things have evolved and changed since then!</description></item><item><title>Mastodon 4.2</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/09/mastodon-4.2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/09/mastodon-4.2/</guid><description>As Mastodon continues to grow, we’d like to make sure we’re doing all we can to help you connect with your friends and your interests. Most importantly, we want to bring you features that make it much easier to connect with people that matter to you.
In this version we overhauled search. The interface for searching is completely new and inspired by the app Ivory—as you type, a popout provides you with quick actions, such as, go directly to hashtag, search only for profiles, or, when writing or pasting a URL, open URL in Mastodon.</description></item><item><title>New merchandise</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/new-merchandise/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/new-merchandise/</guid><description>To help us raise more funds for our development efforts, we are launching a new line of merchandise for Mastodon including t-shirts, mugs, enamel pins, and stickers. Our artist, Dopatwo, has come up with brand new, exclusive designs for each item, and we&amp;rsquo;ve partnered with FRESH Merch to manufacture these items from responsibly sourced materials to the highest degree of quality.
Despite our impressive accomplishments in building out the new social web, Mastodon is a non-profit with a very small team and limited resources&amp;ndash;the core team is just two developers.</description></item><item><title>What to know about Threads</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/what-to-know-about-threads/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/what-to-know-about-threads/</guid><description>Today, Meta is launching its new microblogging platform called Threads. What is noteworthy about this launch is that Threads intends to become part of the decentralized social web by using the same standard protocol as Mastodon, ActivityPub. There’s been a lot of speculation around what Threads will be and what it means for Mastodon. We’ve put together some of the most common questions and our responses based on what was launched today.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon for Android update</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/mastodon-for-android-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/07/mastodon-for-android-update/</guid><description>While usually our app updates don&amp;rsquo;t get a dedicated blog post, this one is a bit bigger and provides a good opportunity to reflect on how the Android app changed since launch roughly a year ago. Today, Mastodon for Android has received a complete Material You redesign. We left no stone unturned—tab bars, settings, composing—everything is refreshed and reflects your color palette.
We&amp;rsquo;ve entirely revamped the previously sparse settings section with dozens of new ways to customize your experience, as well as the ability to access information about the server you&amp;rsquo;re connected to and view its rules.</description></item><item><title>A new onboarding experience on Mastodon</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/05/a-new-onboarding-experience-on-mastodon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/05/a-new-onboarding-experience-on-mastodon/</guid><description>Today we’re making signing up on Mastodon easier than ever before. We understand that deciding which Mastodon service provider to kick off your experience with can be confusing. We know this is a completely new concept for many people, since traditionally the platform and the service provider are one and the same. This choice is what makes Mastodon different from existing social networks, but it also presents a unique onboarding challenge.</description></item><item><title>Twitter suspends Mastodon account, prevents sharing links</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/12/twitter-suspends-mastodon-account-prevents-sharing-links/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/12/twitter-suspends-mastodon-account-prevents-sharing-links/</guid><description>On Dec 16, Twitter suspended our @joinmastodon account after we shared a link to the newly registered Mastodon account of @ElonJet, an account that broadcasts public flight path data of Elon Musk’s private jet, which was previously suspended from Twitter itself. At the same time, accounts of multiple journalists from major publications such as CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post, as well as various independent journalists, were likewise suspended for either linking to the account itself or talking about the event.</description></item><item><title>New website launch</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/09/new-website-launch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/09/new-website-launch/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to announce that our new joinmastodon.org website is now live. We teamed up with the design agency Oak to give our project a modern and professional presence. The website is responsible for explaining what Mastodon is, why it is better than other social media platforms, what makes it unique, and how to get started, and I believe that it has never been as good at those things as it is now.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon branding updates</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/06/mastodon-branding-updates/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/06/mastodon-branding-updates/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re teaming up with the design agency Oak to update our homepage and our brand. We&amp;rsquo;re leaving the ubiquitous blue that every social app seems to have behind in favour of a vibrant purple. Our logo also gets some subtle shape fixes that makes it look more precise.
I originally picked our color palette from a color palette website back in 2016 when I needed something for the interface of my then-hobby project, because it looked nice enough.</description></item><item><title>Twitter buyout puts Mastodon into spotlight</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/04/twitter-buyout-puts-mastodon-into-spotlight/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/04/twitter-buyout-puts-mastodon-into-spotlight/</guid><description>The news of Elon Musk buying Twitter has put Mastodon into the public spotlight as an alternative social network, rapidly exploding our growth with over 30,000 new users in just a single day. This is because at Mastodon, we present a vision of social media that cannot be bought and owned by any billionaire, and strive to create a more resilient global platform without profit incentives. We believe that your ability to communicate online should not be at the whims of a single commercial company.</description></item><item><title>Official apps now available for iOS and Android</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/04/official-apps-now-available-for-ios-and-android/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/04/official-apps-now-available-for-ios-and-android/</guid><description>With the release of our Android app on the Play Store we are now present on both major mobile platforms. The apps are gaining overwhelmingly positive reviews, some even going so far as to claim that our onboarding is smoother than any other social media platform&amp;rsquo;s; our iOS app is rising through the ranks of top social networking apps on the App Store; and for the first time in Mastodon&amp;rsquo;s history, server admins are seeing ever increasing numbers of new sign-ups from mobile apps instead of the web interface.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon 3.5</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/03/mastodon-3.5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/03/mastodon-3.5/</guid><description>Work on multiple features in this release has been kindly sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research through the Prototype Fund.
We&amp;rsquo;ve added one of the most requested functions among our competitors, the ability to edit posts. Since older Mastodon versions would not understand the edits, the function is disabled in the web app until more Mastodon servers upgrade to 3.5, but all parts are already included in the release.</description></item><item><title>Official Mastodon for Android app is coming soon</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/02/official-mastodon-for-android-app-is-coming-soon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/02/official-mastodon-for-android-app-is-coming-soon/</guid><description>Following the successful launch of our official iOS app, in January we&amp;rsquo;ve begun the development of an Android version. We continue working with the NYC design agency Lickability and welcome Gregory Klyushnikov, better known as grishka on the fediverse, as the lead Android developer. Gregory is a talented developer with a history of working on social apps like VKontakte and Telegram.
Continued development is not limited to Android. Work on the app flows into the main Mastodon software as existing APIs are adjusted and new APIs are added to support new features, and the web app&amp;rsquo;s UI is improved with ideas from the professional UX designers working on the iOS and Android apps.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon Recap 2021</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/12/mastodon-recap-2021/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/12/mastodon-recap-2021/</guid><description>Disclaimer: Since Mastodon is decentralized, different Mastodon servers have a different view of the network depending on user activity, and providing an objective data summary across the entire network is not currently possible. Data provided in this blog post is provided as-seen-from mastodon.social, the oldest and one of the more well connected servers, but it is nevertheless biased towards mastodon.social&amp;rsquo;s demographic and may not represent other parts of the fediverse accurately.</description></item><item><title>Trump's new social media platform found using Mastodon code</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/10/trumps-new-social-media-platform-found-using-mastodon-code/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/10/trumps-new-social-media-platform-found-using-mastodon-code/</guid><description>From media reports and individual findings that various people have presented to us, it seems that the new social media platform owned by the former president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, so-called Truth Social, is using Mastodon&amp;rsquo;s source code with various visual adjustments. The platform has not formally launched yet, but it was made accessible ahead of time. Users were quick to note that the terms of service included a worrying passage, claiming that the site is proprietary property and all source code and software are owned or controlled by them or licensed to them:</description></item><item><title>EUNOMIA public pilot launch</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/10/eunomia-public-pilot-launch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/10/eunomia-public-pilot-launch/</guid><description>On behalf of the EUNOMIA project, in which I represent Mastodon, I am happy to announce that after nearly 3 years of development there is now a public pilot for the Mastodon community.
But first, what is EUNOMIA and who is EUNOMIA? EUNOMIA is a &amp;ldquo;digital companion&amp;rdquo; for social media, a set of additional functions that aim to combat the spread of misinformation by helping you critically analyze social media posts before re-sharing them.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon now a non-profit organisation</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/08/mastodon-now-a-non-profit-organisation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/08/mastodon-now-a-non-profit-organisation/</guid><description>In June, I was able to officially register Mastodon gGmbH after nearly 8 months of legal work (&amp;ldquo;gGmbH&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;non-profit limited liability company&amp;rdquo;). A non-profit limited liability company in Germany is structered and operates similarly to a for-profit limited liability company with a few key differences. The founding document of the company is written such that the activity of the company is working towards goals that benefit the public; the shareholders may not receive any revenue from the company&amp;rsquo;s activities and can at most withdraw the funds that they originally paid in; employees may not receive extraordinarily high wages; and the company can receive donations which are then tax-free, although any other income that does not fit the definition of a donation continues to incur various taxes.</description></item><item><title>Developing an official iOS app for Mastodon</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/</guid><description>One of the ways Mastodon sets itself apart from current-day Twitter is its API-first approach (every function available through the web interface is available through the API, in fact, our web client is just an API client that runs in the browser). A third-party app ecosystem contributed in large part to Twitter&amp;rsquo;s success at the beginning, with many innovative features like retweets coming originally from unofficial apps, and it is serving a similarly instrumental role for Mastodon.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon 3.3</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/01/mastodon-3.3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/01/mastodon-3.3/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s Mastodon 3.3 time 🎉 We&amp;rsquo;ve got security fixes, performance fixes, new moderation tools and quality of life features!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why EUNOMIA builds on Mastodon</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2020/08/why-eunomia-builds-on-mastodon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2020/08/why-eunomia-builds-on-mastodon/</guid><description>An ever growing problem of the modern social media-rich world is misinformation. The trust that was previously placed into government officials and journalism has eroded; the internet gave everyone a voice but with it made it so much more difficult to distinguish truth from fabrication. The consequences of this are very real: Almost eradicated illnesses are making a comeback because people refuse to vaccinate their children, Covid-19 is continuing to spread because people refuse to wear masks and practice social distancing, more and more people start believing that the Earth is flat and descend down a rabbit hole of ever more absurd conspiracy theories.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon 3.2</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2020/08/mastodon-3.2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2020/08/mastodon-3.2/</guid><description>The new Mastodon release brings you a much better audio player and improved support for different audio and video formats, as well as some additional security mechanisms.
The audio player has been completely reworked to have a more eye-catching design. It will extract album art from the uploaded audio file automatically, or allow you to upload a thumbnail of your own choosing to be displayed in the center. Dominant colors from the artwork or thumbnail will then be used to give the player a unique look.</description></item><item><title>Adding sign-up to your Mastodon app</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/10/adding-sign-up-to-your-mastodon-app/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/10/adding-sign-up-to-your-mastodon-app/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since Mastodon 2.7, it is actually possible to let users sign up through your app, instead of asking them to go to a Mastodon website directly and then return.

Mastodon 3.0 is live! The team has been hard at work on making sure that this release is one of our most user-friendly yet with some exciting new features! Here are just a few:
Stronger anti-harassment tools We&amp;rsquo;re always looking for new ways to provide users and admins with the most robust and comprehensive tools to combat harassment on the fediverse.

We have never had any sympathy for their thinly (if at all) veiled white supremacist platform so that was not a welcome move on our part, however the license that we publish our software under (AGPLv3) allows anyone to use it as they see fit as long as they keep the same license and make their modifications public.</description></item><item><title>Mastodon 2.9</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/06/mastodon-2.9/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2019 00:58:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/06/mastodon-2.9/</guid><description>One of the biggest obstacles for new users to Mastodon has been the multi-column UI. For users accustomed to the single-column layouts of Twitter or Tumblr, Mastodon’s multi-column layout can be overwhelming. At Mastodon, we want users’ first-day experience with us to be a positive and accessible one! A UI that feels cluttered or that leaves users confused dramatically reduces the chances that they will come back to Mastodon as a regular user.</description></item><item><title>How to migrate from one server to another</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/06/how-to-migrate-from-one-server-to-another/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/06/how-to-migrate-from-one-server-to-another/</guid><description>With the sad news that KNZK was shutting down we thought it might be useful for people to have a refresher on the features that Mastodon has built in that make moving instances easy and painless.

One of the things that gave impetus to the creation of Mastodon was a lack of moderation on Twitter against hate groups. The &amp;ldquo;no nazis&amp;rdquo; rule of the original mastodon.social server not only continues to serve as a major attraction of the project, but has also been adopted in the majority of subsequently founded communities as well.</description></item><item><title>Improving support for adult content on Mastodon</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/05/improving-support-for-adult-content-on-mastodon/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/05/improving-support-for-adult-content-on-mastodon/</guid><description>The latest point release of Mastodon adds a small new feature that might have a significant impact on all adult content creators on the platform.

So you want to join Mastodon and get tooting. Great! Here&amp;rsquo;s how to dive straight in.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the basics. What is this? Mastodon is a microblogging platform akin to others you may have seen, such as Twitter, but instead of being centralised it is a federated network which operates in a similar way to email.
Like email, you choose your server and whether it&amp;rsquo;s GMail, Outlook, iCloud, wherever you sign up you know you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to email everyone you need to so long as you know their address.</description></item><item><title>Cage the Mastodon</title><link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/</guid><description>&lt;p>A year ago I wrote about Mastodon&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2017/03/learning-from-twitters-mistakes/">improvements over Twitter&amp;rsquo;s lacking protections against abuse and harassment&lt;/a>.

Delete &amp;amp; Redraft There are legitimate reasons why social media platforms rarely, if ever, have an editing function.

To balance out the doom and gloom of an internet wholly under the thrall of corporate interests and fed through single channels devoid of competition, it’s worth being aware of just how pervasive and powerful an idea decentralization is in the 21st century.
